1. Email Overview
- File: sample-1395.eml  
- Type: Phishing email (link-based, no attachments)  
- Sender Domain: Spoofs *unesco.hk* branding  
- Delivery Method: HTML body with embedded malicious links

2. Authentication Results (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
- SPF: None - fearandgreedapp.com` does not publish a valid SPF record.  
- DKIM: Signature verified for fearandgreedapp.com (via `mlz664.onmicrosoft.com`).  
- DMARC: bestguesspass - No explicit DMARC enforcement in place.  
- ARC (Authenticated Received Chain): fail.  
Implication: 
Attackers exploited weak domain authentication. Since SPF was not defined and DMARC not enforced, this allowed spoofed emails to bypass filters despite a valid DKIM alignment. 

3. Observed Social Engineering Tactics
- Brand Impersonation: Pretends to be UNESCO Hong Kong Association.  
- Legitimacy Cloak: Uses a real UNESCO domain link `https://unesco.hk/web/` in the footer for trust-building.  
- Newsletter Pretext: Claims the user is subscribed to a newsletter — creates curiosity and urgency to "change profile".  
- Hidden Tracking: Embedded 1x1 tracking pixel (`djcaice.r.bh.d.sendibt3.com`) likely monitors opens/clicks.

4. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
Malicious URLs
1. Primary phishing redirect:
hxxps[://]eurealdocumentsprovider[.]com/tto/k5CG3rT6rvrT8h[.]php?email=phishing@pot
2. Obfuscated "Change your profile" link:
hxxps[://]djcaice[.]r[.]bh[.]d[.]sendibt3[.]com/tr/cl/GC2IQgpNQj9OKZYCua8
3. Tracking pixel:
hxxps[://]djcaice[.]r[.]bh[.]d[.]sendibt3[.]com/tr/op/NhCzc-KU6Kq-tjC5Vi9TNiH5Jx0NEcl
4. Benign but abused for credibility:
https://unesco.hk/web/
Other Observations
- No attachments (only inline HTML & images).  
- Embedded remote image:
hxxps[://]cdn[.]shopify[.]com/s/files/[.][.][.]/sdgfdfvsdfv[.]png

5. Risk Assessment
- Threat Level: High  
- Potential Impact: Credential harvesting, user tracking, redirect to further malware payloads.  
- Target Audience: General users — exploiting trust in UNESCO branding.

6. Recommendations
1. Block IOCs: 
 - Add malicious URLs & domains to the blocklist on mail gateways, proxies, and firewalls.  
2. User Awareness:
 - Train users to spot fake newsletters and hover over links before clicking.  
 - Emphasize that legitimate organizations won’t embed tracking pixels with malicious redirects.  
3. Technical Controls: 
 - Enable sandboxing/detonation for suspicious emails.  
 - Disable automatic image loading in email clients to prevent tracking pixel activation.  
4. Incident Response:
 - If users clicked, reset credentials immediately.  
 - Monitor for suspicious login attempts from unusual IPs.  
5. Long-term Strategy: 
 - Deploy DMARC with reject/quarantine policy on domains.  
 - Ensure SPF and DKIM are correctly configured and enforced.  
 - Continuously update phishing awareness programs.
